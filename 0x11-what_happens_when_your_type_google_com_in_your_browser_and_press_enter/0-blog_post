Introduction
This report aims to demystify the complex process that occurs when a URL, specifically https://www.google.com, is entered into a web browser and Enter is pressed. This process involves several steps, from the initial DNS request to the final display of the webpage.

1. DNS Request
Function: The Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain name www.google.com into an IP address recognizable by the computer.
Process: The browser checks its cache for the DNS record. If not found, it queries a DNS server for the IP address.
2. TCP/IP
Role: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) establish a pathway for data exchange.
Connection: TCP sets up a reliable connection between the browser and the server, ensuring data packets are sent and received in order.
3. Firewall
Purpose: Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
Security: Ensures the user's request is secure and blocks any harmful traffic.
4. HTTPS/SSL
HTTPS: Stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, providing a secure connection.
SSL Handshake: Involves the exchange of SSL certificates for encrypting the data, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
5. Load Balancer
Objective: To distribute network traffic across multiple servers.
Load Balancing: This prevents any single server from being overwhelmed, ensuring efficient handling of requests and maintaining website performance.
6. Web Server
Role: A web server handles the HTTP request and sends back the requested HTML content.
Static Content: It serves static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
7. Application Server
Function: Manages the application's operations between users and an organization's backend business applications or databases.
Dynamic Content: Executes backend logic to dynamically generate webpage content.
8. Database
Usage: Stores and retrieves data as required by the application server.
Interaction: The application server queries the database for information, which is then used to build the webpage.
Conclusion
This report outlined the intricate process involved from the moment https://www.google.com is entered in the browser to when the Google homepage is displayed. Each step, from DNS lookup to database interaction, plays a vital role in delivering web content swiftly and securely to users.
