To complete these tasks, you'll need to create a diagram illustrating the web request process and contribute to an existing GitHub project with meaningful content. Here's how you can approach these tasks:

Task 1: Create a Diagram
Steps to Create the Diagram:
Choose a Tool: Use a diagramming tool like Gliffy, draw.io, or any other that you're comfortable with.

Diagram Components: Your diagram should include the following components:

DNS Resolution
Request hitting the server IP on the appropriate port
Encrypted Traffic (indicating HTTPS/SSL)
Traffic passing through a Firewall
Distribution of the request via a Load Balancer
Web Server responding with a webpage
Application Server generating the webpage
Application Server requesting data from the Database
Design the Flow: Arrange these components in the order they are used in the process. Use arrows to indicate the direction of data flow.

Annotations: Add brief descriptions or labels to each component to explain their role.

Export and Host the Diagram: Once your diagram is complete, export it as an image file and host it on a platform like Imgur, Dropbox, or directly on GitHub if youâ€™re using draw.io.

Submission:
Share the URL of your diagram image in your answer file and in the required field.
